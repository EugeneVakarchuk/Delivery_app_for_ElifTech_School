## Unrealized finctionality:

Because I must complited this task for 3 days, and it's my firs e-commerce pet-project, some functional didn't realize or wrong realized so in time for the deadline.

If I had more time, I will realize:

-   Optimize endpoins from server. After created this project I understood, that firstly need to create theese endpointes that will useing most often. It's saved a lot of time and DRY would not be violated.
-   Creat placeholders for loading elements.
-   Adaptive styles from 4-5 width's breakpoints.
